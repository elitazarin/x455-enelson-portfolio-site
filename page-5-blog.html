        <p>I’m about a month out from my 
          second half marathon and I’m 
          feeling pretty good. I’m 
          visiting Eugene, Oregon right 
          now. I don’t know what’s in 
          the air out here in Track 
          Town, USA, but I’ve been 
          hitting better times than 
          I did back in St. Louis. 
          I occasionally get bummed 
          out that I’m slow. Definitely 
          slower than my high school 
          self at least. I’m a little 
          stronger than the Elita that 
          ran my last half marathon 
          though. That’s something I 
          need to remind myself. That, 
          and the fact that I love running 
          and am blessed to be able to 
          do so whenever I’d like.
